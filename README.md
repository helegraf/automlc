# AutoMLC
Automated Multi-label Classification Repository

This project presents GA-Auto-MLC and Auto-MEKA_GGP, two methods that automatically select and configure multi-label classification algorithms based on the [MEKA tool](http://waikato.github.io/meka/). If you use this project in your work, please cite the following papers:
